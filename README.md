# Tellraw Logger

A simple mod for 1.21.8+ that logs `/tellraw` messages to the console. It overwrites the `TellRawCommand.register` static method, so it may conflict with other mods that also change `/tellraw`.

Created for use with [Amethyst](https://github.com/kinderhead/Amethyst).

Backporting is trivial if there's demand.
